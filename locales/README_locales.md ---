# la_peditor Locales (1950s-cartoon-noir)

Files placed under `locales/` provide translation tables.

- `locales.lua` loads languages and exposes a backward-compatible `_L(key, ...)` global if none is present.
- `en.lua` contains English translations used by the resource.
- Use `_TEMPLATE.lua` as a starting point for additional languages.

**Notes**
- Strings include theme metadata where useful (e.g., theme="1950s-cartoon-noir").
- For future refactor, call `exports['la_peditor']:GetLocale()` instead of relying on global `_L`.
